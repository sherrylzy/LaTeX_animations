# LaTeX_animations

LaTeX/Tikz animations which I use for course 
material in electronics courses. The animations 
are rendered by Tikz and a multipage pdf is 
created with one page per frame. These can 
then be extracted and converted to animations 
by software like convert from ImageMagick.org

I use MikTeX under Windows and particularly XeLaTeX.
